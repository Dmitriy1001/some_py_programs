look_n_say

The look and say sequence is a sequence in which each number is the result of a "look and say" operation on the previous element.
Considering for example the classical version startin with "1": ["1", "11", "21, "1211", "111221", ...]. You can see that the second element describes
the first as "1(times number)1", the third is "2(times number)1" describing the second, the fourth is "1(times number)2(and)1(times number)1" and so on.

The function takes a starting string (not necessarily the classical "1") and return the nth element of the series.

valid_number_british

In the UK mobile numbers begin with '07' followed by 9 other digits, e.g. '07454876120'.
Sometimes the number is preceded by the country code, the prefix '+44', which replaces the '0' in ‘07’, e.g. '+447454876120'.
And sometimes you will find numbers with dashes in-between digits or on either side, e.g. '+44--745---487-6120' or '-074-54-87-61-20-'. 
As you can see, dashes may be consecutive.

The function checks if the string is a valid UK mobile phone number or not
